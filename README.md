- 👋 Hi, I’m @Piepsii

- 👀 I’m interested in creating games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things:
  - 🏫 I am studying game design and programming at the Uppsala University in Visby, Sweden.
  - 💻 Learning how to use Unity & JetBrains Rider on a Linux system.
  - Learning how to write OpenGL shader code used for real-time 3D graphic computation.
  - Learning game programming patterns and game engine tools in order to create my own at some point (hopefully).
  - Learning the basics of game AI.
  - 📓 Writing C++ and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on indie games and FOSS!
